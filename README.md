# Code
There is already a lot of available code, especially from Pimoroni themselves; here's how I edited it for my own use.

## Code

If you do not want to download the .py file, you can just copy the following to your clipboard.

# Tips
I have been using the filament I have here because it's just available. I think this would look better in black (Prusa has a really nice galaxy black filament).
